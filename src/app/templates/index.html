            <p class="lead">A task tracking system for inter-related
                projects.</p>

            <p>StoryBoard lets you track what needs to be done across projects
                and branches.
                It is a proof-of-concept demo of what the ideal OpenStack task
                tracker would
                look like. It may or may not end up replacing Launchpad
                Bugs/Blueprints for OpenStack task tracking and release
                management.</p>

            <h2>Stories</h2>

            <p>It all begins with a <strong>story</strong>. A story is a bug
                report or proposed feature. Stories are then further split into
                <strong>tasks</strong>, which affect a given project and branch.
                You can easily track backports of bugs to a specific branch, or
                plan cross-project features.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>

            <p>StoryBoard lets you efficiently track your work across a large
                number of interrelated projects. Flexible <strong>project
                    groups</strong> lets you get the views that makes the most
                sense to you.</p>

            <h2>But why?</h2>

            <p>The OpenStack project is now running into a number of limitations
                and annoying differences in workflow with Launchpad. At the same
                time, Launchpad development stalled, leaving us with little
                chances to improve the tool to suit our needs. This POC reuses
                key Launchpad concepts (like bug tasks) and goes beyond.</p>
