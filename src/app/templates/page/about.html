            <h2>Stories</h2>

            <p>It all begins with a <strong>story</strong>. A story is a
                bug report or proposed feature. Stories are then further
                split into <strong>tasks</strong>, which affect a given
                project and branch. You can easily track backports of
                bugs to a specific branch, or plan cross-project
                features.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>

            <p>StoryBoard lets you efficiently track your work across a
                large number of interrelated projects. Flexible
                <strong>project groups</strong> lets you get the views
                that makes the most sense to you.</p>

            <h2>But why?</h2>

            <p>The OpenStack project is now running into a number of limitations
                and annoying differences in workflow with Launchpad. At the
                same time, Launchpad development stalled, leaving us with little
                chances to improve the tool to suit our needs. This POC
                reuses key Launchpad concepts (like bug tasks) and goes
                beyond.</p>
